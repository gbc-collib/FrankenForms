# FrankenForms
 - A library with standalone angular components that I have written for creating reactive forms on webpages. I wanted to give these a place to live because I have ended up reusing them a bit and they are a bit annoying to get up and running, I also plan to have them implement angular's form API so you can bind to them easily in a FormGroup.

## Contributing
 - I'm still very new to angular so feel free to PR with updates or style fixes
 - Also feel free to PR if you would like to re-create the components under another framework.
 - Use the angular naming convention when creating new folders for components
## TODO:
 -[ ] Convert all Components to standalones
 -[ ] Fully implement forms API
